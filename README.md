# tarkov-settings (fullscreen hotkey +presets fork)
![screenshot](./1.png)

I am not a C# programmer. Do not use unless absolutely necessary. 
All the changes can be helpful for fullscreen users since original tarkov-setting does not work in fullscreen mode
+ added 3 customizable presets 
+ added hotkeys for the presets (alt+Num1, alt+Num2, alt+Num3)
+ added hotkeys for +10 and -10 gamma offset (alt+UP, alt+DOWN)
+ added manual apply with a hotkey (alt+Num0)
- fixed brigtness and contrast bars min values (did nothing below 0)

TODO list:
- rename preset 1 an 2 because Intercharge now has similar to other maps color correction
- add custom preset key settings
- disable autoupdate (because it check original tarkov-settings version and not my fork)

## [->**DOWNLOAD original Latest**<-](https://github.com/incheon-kim/tarkov-settings/releases/latest)

Automatically change color settings for [Escape from Tarkov](https://escapefromtarkov.com).

## How it works?
- Changes Digital Vibrance value from Nvidia Settings using [NvAPIWrapper](https://github.com/falahati/NvAPIWrapper)
- Changes Gamma using some [Win32 API calls](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/wingdi/nf-wingdi-setdevicegammaramp)

It only changes your display's colors when Escape from Tarkov's window is in focus.
This leaves a smooth transition when minimizing/maximizing.

## Supported Graphic Cards
- Nvidia GPU **fully supported.** (Brightness/Contrast/Gamma/Saturation)
- AMD GPU **partially supported.** (Except Saturation)
- **Intel/Etc is not supported yet.**

## What does it do?
You can change any of the following color settings:
1. Brightness
2. Contrast
3. Gamma
4. Digital Vibrance Control (aka. Saturation)
5. Only affects display while EFT window is focussed (It also prevents **sudden flash during Alt-tabbing**)

## How to Use
1. Open application (SmartGuard might prevent opening as it's not signed)
2. Set any color value
2.1. Double-click any slider labels to reset their values.
3. Minimize and play EFT
4. Close application if you want to deactivate

**Exit the app from your taskbar to create a `settings.json` file that will remember your settings**

## Warning
1. It might blink couple times when you active EFT window but it works. Don't worry.
2. **Disclaimer: I don't know BSG will ban for using this.**
3. AMD only supports Brightness/Contrast/Gamma Controls
4. Intel Graphic Cards are not supported
5. Only works in **Borderless mode.**
6. Nvidia Optimus Environment (mostly laptops) is not tested.
